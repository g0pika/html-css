<p>Although most polar bears are born on land, they spend most of their time on the sea ice. Their scientific name means "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea">maritime</a> bear" and derives from this fact. Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice, often living off fat reserves when no <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_ice">sea ice</a> is present. Because of their dependence on the sea ice, polar bears are classified as <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_mammal">marine mammals</a>.</p>
